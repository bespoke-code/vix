The index covering 56 countries is a composite measure of the current status of a nation's environmental systems, pressures on those systems, human vulnerability to environmental change, national capacity to respond, and contributions to global environmental stewardship. The index was unveiled at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, January 2000, Davos, Switzerland. The 2000 Pilot ESI is the result of collaboration among the World Economic Forum (WEF), Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), and the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). (Suggested Usage: To test the feasibility of creating a comparative index of national-level environmental sustainability.)",

The index is a composite measure of the current status of a nation's environmental systems, pressures on those systems, human vulnerability to environmental change, national capacity to respond, and contributions to global environmental stewardship. The refinements included the addition and deletion of indicators, filling gaps in data coverage, new data sets, and the modification of the aggregation scheme. The index was unveiled at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, January 2001, Davos, Switzerland. The 2001 ESI is the result of collaboration among the World Economic Forum (WEF), Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), and the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) (Suggested Usage: To provide a comparative index of national-level environmental sustainability based on lessons learned from the year 2000 pilot effort.)",

            "description": "The 2008 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) centers on two broad environmental protection objectives: (1) reducing environmental stresses on human \n\nhealth, and (2) promoting ecosystem vitality and sound natural resource management. Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin goals mirror the priorities \n\nexpressed by policymakers. Environmental health and ecosystem vitality are gauged using 25 indicators tracked in six well-established policy categories: Environmental Health \n\n(Environmental Burden of Disease, Water, and Air Pollution), Air Pollution (effects on ecosystems), Water (effects on ecosystems), Biodiversity and Habitat, Productive Natural Resources \n\n(Forestry, Fisheries, and Agriculture), and Climate Change. The 2008 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target methodology in which performance on each indicator is rated on a 0 to 100 scale \n\n(100 represents at target). By identifying specific targets and measuring how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a foundation for policy analysis and a context for \n\nevaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant peer groups. The 2008 EPI is the result of \n\ncollaboration among the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), World Economic \n\nForum (WEF), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.",

Vegetation characteristics reported include species growth habit, leaf area, mass, and mass loss with senescence. The data were compiled from 86 selected studies in 31 countries, and resulted in approximately 1,000 data points for both green and senesced leaves from woody and non-woody vegetation as described in Vergutz et al (2012). The studies were conducted from 1970-2009. There are two comma-delimited data files with this data set.",

Soil respiration, the flux of autotropically- and heterotrophically-generated CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere remains the least well-constrained component of the terrestrial C cycle. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual RS, mean seasonal RS, a seasonal or annual partitioning of RS into its sources fluxes, RS temperature response (Q10), or RS at 10 degrees C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. Data from 818 studies have been entered into the database, constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961-2007 and are dominated by temperate, well-drained forests. The database includes a file of RS data and a linked file of study bibliographic data. Both files are in comma-separated format.",
