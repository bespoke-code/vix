A 2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge solution for the Data Concierge challenge.

## About the challenge

**Develop an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data users and enthusiasts find datasets and resources of interest!**

With eighteen satellites and three instruments aboard the International Space Station observing the Earth, Earth science enthusiasts and Earth data users have access to terabytes of information to browse and use at their fingertips!

Your challenge is to design an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data consumers navigate NASAâ€™s Earth science datasets and resources!  Help users identify which datasets are useful to them and how to access them.

Full details about the challenge can be found [on the official 2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge site.](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/ideate-and-create/data-concierge/details)

## About our solution

We love those who do research. Our goal is to provide them with the best datasets possible for them to do it. There comes Vix - our personal data concierge.

We use [this NASA JSON metadata file](https://data.nasa.gov/data.json) as our main dataset and data extraction point.

Vix aims to improve users' ability to search quickly and effectively through the vast number of NASA datasets using multiple smart systems:
- Dataset Filters (temporal, spatial and keyword filters)
- Neural Network (using 

Vix can also recommend datasets based on your personal preferences, and take other users' dataset ratings into account.
