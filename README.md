A 2017 NASA Space Apps Challenge solution for the Data Concierge challenge.

## About the challenge

**Develop an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data users and enthusiasts find datasets and resources of interest!**

With eighteen satellites and three instruments aboard the International Space Station observing the Earth, Earth science enthusiasts and Earth data users have access to terabytes of information to browse and use at their fingertips!

Your challenge is to design an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data consumers navigate NASAâ€™s Earth science datasets and resources!  Help users identify which datasets are useful to them and how to access them.
